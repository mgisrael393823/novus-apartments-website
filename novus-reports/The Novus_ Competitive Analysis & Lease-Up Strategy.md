# The Novus: Competitive Analysis & Lease-Up Strategy
## Executive Summary

The Novus is poised to enter the Downtown Durham multifamily market at a pivotal time. Located in the vibrant Five Points District at 115 Morris St, this 27-story development with 188 rental apartments and over 22,000 square feet of ground floor retail will be competing in a market characterized by moderating rents, elevated construction activity, and strong but uneven absorption.

## Market Intelligence

The Durham multifamily market is showing signs of adjustment with several key indicators:

- **Vacancy Rate:** Approximately 6% metro-wide, with occupancy rates hovering around 94%
- **Rent Trends:** Declining rents (-12.8% year-over-year for one-bedrooms), creating a "renter's market"
- **Absorption:** Strong demand with record absorption numbers, though not keeping pace with new deliveries
- **Construction:** Record deliveries in the Raleigh-Durham area with 12,002 units completed in 2024
- **Concessions:** Widespread, with competitors offering 1-2 months free rent and additional incentives

The Downtown Durham submarket remains desirable due to its walkability, dining scene, and urban amenities, but is experiencing significant new supply with multiple luxury properties competing for residents.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths
- Prime location in the Five Points District
- Newest property in the submarket (2025 delivery)
- Tallest residential building (27 stories) offering superior views
- Distinctive amenity package including outdoor movie theater, golf simulators, and pickleball court
- Mixed-use development with 22,000+ square feet of ground floor retail

### Weaknesses
- Entering a market with moderating rents and elevated concessions
- Premium pricing ($2,150-$8,732) in a price-sensitive market
- Unproven property with no established reputation
- 188 units represents significant inventory to absorb

### Opportunities
- Growing demand for remote work-friendly apartments
- Limited true high-rise competition in downtown Durham
- Enhanced technology integration to differentiate from competitors
- Retail curation to create a destination within downtown Durham
- Service-oriented management to address common pain points

### Threats
- Aggressive concessions from competitors (up to 2 months free)
- Continued rent moderation affecting luxury rental demand
- Competition from established properties with resident bases
- Economic uncertainty affecting luxury rental demand
- Rising construction costs affecting project delivery

## Competitive Landscape

The Novus will compete directly with six key properties in the Downtown Durham area:

1. **Van Alen** - Urban sanctuary concept with sophisticated design, offering $2,000 off select units
2. **One City Center** - High-rise with rooftop pool and lounge, offering up to 1 month free
3. **Berkshire Ninth Street** - Near Duke with extensive amenities including rock climbing wall, offering up to $1,000 off studios
4. **Beckon Apartments** - Near Central Park with Belt Line access, offering up to 2 months free plus $750 gift card
5. **Cortland Bull City** - Downtown with skyline views, studios from $1,411, offering 1 month free
6. **511 Faye** - High-rise format with luxury positioning

All competitors are offering significant concessions (1-2 months free) and emphasizing location and amenities in their marketing. The Novus enters as the newest and potentially most premium offering, with distinct advantages in building height, amenity package, and mixed-use integration.

   - Create signature resident events leveraging unique spaces
   - Develop wellness-focused amenity programming

4. **Mixed-Use Integration**

   - Create resident benefits program with on-site retailers
   - Develop programming that activates retail spaces for residents

## Lease-Up Strategy

**Phase 3: Acceleration (Months 4-6)**

- Implement targeted incentives for slower-moving unit types
- Leverage initial resident testimonials in marketing
- Target 60-70% occupancy by end of Phase 3

**Phase 4: Stabilization (Months 7-12)**
